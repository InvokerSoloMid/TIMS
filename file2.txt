I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind (blind)
Your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind (blind)
Your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise

[Verse 1]
Get out of my head
Someone save me from this madness, I'd rather be dead
All I see is reality
Fabricated by something I refuse to see
You know who I am
You created me by letting yourself believe
Take my cold dead hands and go six feet down
Your failure is found

[Chorus]
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind (blind)
Your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind (blind)
Your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise

[Bridge]
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
Take me away, I just want out
From this self-imprisoned self-made hell

[Verse 2]
Don't be surprised, this is your mind
Coming to life by self-sacrifice
This tragedy of death will walk hand in hand with every thought of regret
Blame yourself for what you've become
The mind is a powerful thing set to self-destruct (destruct)
Mind-fucked (mind-fucked)
You had your chance, your time, this is the end of the line

This is the end of the line
This is the end

[Chorus]
I am dementia in your mind
Creator of decisions, violent visions and lies
Blind (blind)
Your eyes forever blind
Reality is dead by your force fed demise

[Outro]
We will slowly rot until this is stopped
